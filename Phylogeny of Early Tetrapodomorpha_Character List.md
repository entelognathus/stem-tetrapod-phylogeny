> Cloutier et al. (2020): The term “radial” refers to endoskeletal elements located distally to the first row of proximal carpals (i.e., radiale, intermedium and tibiale). “Proximal radials” refer to the first proximo-distal row of elements (also referred to as “central carpals”) located distally to the proximal carpals. Proximal radials include the A4 element. “Intermediate radials” refer to the second proximo-distal row of elements located distally to the proximal radials and including the A5 elements. All the elements located distally to the intermediate radials are referred to as “distal radials” (or phalanges). This terminology follows that used by Wagner & Chiu (2001) and Johanson et al. (2007).
