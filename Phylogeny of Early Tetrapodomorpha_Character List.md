# Character list of Tetrapodomorpha
 
## Daeschler et al. (2006); Swartz (2012); Clack et al. (2012); Zhu et al. (2017); Chen et al. (2018); Cloutier et al. (2020); Clement et al. (2021); Lu et al. (2012); Long et al. (2006); Holland et al. (2009); Choo et al. (2024)

> The dipnomorph taxa *Youngolepis*, *Diabolepis*, *Powichthys*, *Porolepis* and *Glyptolepis* were designated as a monophyletic outgroup. Multistate characters were treated as unordered unless they formed clear morphoclines, in which case they were ordered (characters 7, 10, 20, 34, 42, 63, 73, 78, 84, 98, 100, 107, 130, 139, 162, 198, 199 and 201). All characters are weighted equally.

> Characters 203-206 were added by Clement *et al*. (2021). Rather than being cited as a composite taxon, *Megalichthys* was represented by *M. hibberti* and *M. laticeps* in addition to *M. mullisoni* (Downs & Daeschler, 2020), all as separate species in Clement *et al*. (2021). *Mahalalepis resima* (Young, Long & Ritchie, 1992), *Askerichthys heintziorum* (Borgen & Nakrem, 2016), *Palatinichthys laticeps* (Witzmann & Schoch, 2012), *Sengoerichthys ottoman* (Janvier, Clément & Cloutier, 2007), were added to the taxon list of Zhu *et al*. (2017) and Cloutier *et al*. (2020).

> *Parmastega* was added in the dataset by Simões and Pierce (2021). Simões and Pierce (2021) removed a total of 27 characters and recorded seven characters (**three split into two characters**), altering 15% of the original dataset and resulting in a revised and updated dataset for their subsequent analyses. This dataset was not followed herein.

> Cloutier et al. (2020): The term “radial” refers to endoskeletal elements located distally to the first row of proximal carpals (i.e., radiale, intermedium and tibiale). “Proximal radials” refer to the first proximo-distal row of elements (also referred to as “central carpals”) located distally to the proximal carpals. Proximal radials include the A4 element. “Intermediate radials” refer to the second proximo-distal row of elements located distally to the proximal radials and including the A5 elements. All the elements located distally to the intermediate radials are referred to as “distal radials” (or phalanges). This terminology follows that used by Wagner & Chiu (2001) and Johanson et al. (2007).

> Long *et al*. (2006): Based on plesiomorphic archipterygial fin patterns (e.g. dipnoans, porolepiforms) we assume that primary mesomere (A1) lacks a well- developed entepicondyle, so the extensive developments of such a feature are here considered to be derived within tetrapodomorphs. We measure the entepicondylar process as being the ventrally-orientated flange coming off the humeral shaft, measured from the ventral humeral shaft edge to its widest extent relative to maximum humeral shaft length. Thus in *Gogonasus*, as shown in Fig.1a, the entepicondyle is clearly much shorter in its width than the humerus is long.
